# Cura15.04.06-MKS
Since the plug-in function below the cura3.x version is not flexible enough to directly use the mks wifi plugin, but considering that many users are still using cura15.x versions, mks have added support for mks wifi directly based on [cura15.06.04](https://github.com/daid/LegacyCura) Control function and preview picture function of slice production gcode.
## Features
- Connect to the mks robin wifi and mks tft wifi. Thus, you can control your 3d printer wirelessly. What is more, transferring gcode files to a printer can usually reach 100kbyte/s. 
- The plugin also support previewing gcode file when using MKS Robin TFT35 or MKS TFT35 LCD.
