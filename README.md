# Cura15.04.06-MKS
The plug-in function below cura3.x version is not flexible enough to directly use the mks wifi plug-in. Considering that many users are still using the cura15.x version, mks directly adds support for mks wifi based on [cura15.04.6](https://github.com/daid/LegacyCura) . Thus users can achieve in LAN:
- Connect to the mks robin wifi or mks tft wifi. Thus, you can control your 3d printer wirelessly. What is more, transferring gcode files to a printer can usually reach 100kbyte/s. 
- The plugin also support previewing gcode file when using MKS Robin TFT35 or MKS TFT35 LCD.
